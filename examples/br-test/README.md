## [Example based on Thi.ng's Amazing Umbrella MonoRepo](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella)

Specifically, I made a copy of the create example script (which included
references to Thi.ng naturally, as author, etc.) in order to make sure
viewers know this is just an example I have made to try to understand
and play around with this amazing tool-kit.
